Welcome to my data analysis repository! This collection of projects showcases my skills in data exploration, machine learning, and data visualization.

What You'll Find:

Data Exploration: Dive into exploratory data analysis (EDA) of various datasets, where I uncover hidden patterns, trends, and anomalies, using a combination of statistical analysis and data visualization.

Machine Learning: Explore projects where I apply machine learning algorithms to solve real-world problems, from predictive modeling to classification and clustering tasks.

Data Visualization: Witness the power of data visualization in conveying complex information through captivating charts, graphs, and interactive dashboards.

Statistical Analysis: Discover in-depth statistical analyses that provide valuable insights and inform data-driven decisions.

Data Cleaning: Learn about the crucial process of data preprocessing and cleaning, where I transform messy datasets into structured, usable information.

In the upcoming days you will get more real world projects from different moduls.
